ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm John Thuo!

I'm a passionate Back-End Web Developer and Software Engineer with a strong interest in Machine Learning. I believe in the power of code to transform ideas into reality and strive to build robust and efficient solutions.

Currently, I'm exploring the fascinating realms of Cloud Development, Networking, Artificial Intelligence Systems Programming, and Mobile Development using Flutter. I'm eager to expand my knowledge and keep up with the latest advancements in these fields.

In addition to my technical pursuits, I find solace in the world of poetry. I've created a repository dedicated to my poetic endeavors, which you can explore at [Poetry](https://github.com/john-thuo1/Poetry). Feel free to take a look and share your thoughts!
